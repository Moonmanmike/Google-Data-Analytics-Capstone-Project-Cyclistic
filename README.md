# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-Cyclistic
Cyclistic case study

-For the Google Data Analytics Capstone project, I decided to work on the Cyclistic  bike share case study. For this case study, I performed the real-world tasks of a junior data analyst for the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.

-I followed the six steps of the data analysis process which consist of:Â Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

*The tools used to conduct the Cyclistic case study*
--Utilized Microsoft Excel for initial analysis and prep
--Data cleaning, validation and exploration with Google BigQuery
--Data visualization with Tableau Public
